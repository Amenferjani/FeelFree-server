Create a Community:

Users can create a new community by providing a name and description. The creator will be the user making the request, and they will automatically be added as the first member.
The community's name must be unique, and the service should ensure that a community with the same name does not already exist (by throwing an error if it does).

Assign Moderators:

The mods field allows the creator or existing moderators to assign other users as moderators, enabling them to manage the community.
You can implement functionality to add or remove users from the mods array.

Tagging Communities:

Communities can be tagged with relevant keywords using the tags array, allowing better discoverability or filtering.

Community Media Management:

Communities can have a logo and banner image, allowing for a unique visual identity.
You can implement upload and update functionality for these images.
Manage Membership:

Track the number of members in the community using the numberOfMembers field.
Implement a join/leave functionality where users can join or leave the community, updating this count.
Post Creation in Community:

Since posts are tied to a community via an ObjectId reference, users can create posts within a specific community, which would link the post to that community.
Functionality could include fetching all posts related to a specific community.
Community Discovery and Search:

Users should be able to search and discover communities by name, tags, or description.
Filtering and searching by tags can improve user experience in finding communities of interest.
Error Handling for Duplicate Communities:

If someone tries to create a community with an already existing name, your service should handle this by throwing a validation error due to the unique constraint.
Updating Community Information:

You can allow moderators or the creator to update the communityâ€™s description, tags, or media (logo/banner).
